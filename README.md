<h1> What are you dreaming? </h1>
<h3> Is it something good? </h3>
<h5> When will you wake up? </h5>
<p> Carrie dreamed that she was in a lush violet and blue world that smelled like melting sugar and jasmine blossoms. Her tears felt as hot as tea water and she was warm. There were tidepools at her feet full of green sea glass and starfish and the salt wind whipped her hair around her head.
<br>
<br>
Carrie heard the echoes of sea coves, and saw their light reflected on the clouds and the fog hung around her neck like a scarf. Carrie had blood running down her arms and legs.
<br>
<br>
She woke up and the red stains soaked into her hair and her dress that she had sowed from scrapped silk. She was shivering cold and the air smelled like iron, not salt, and there was no ocean for miles and miles.
